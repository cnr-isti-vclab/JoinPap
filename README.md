# JoinPap

Joinpap is a software tool developed in the ambit of the PNRR 2022 project entitled "Reconstructing Fragmentary Papyri through Human-Machine Interaction: case studies from two Italian collections",
a joint effort between the Istituto Papirologico "Girolamo Vitelli" in Florence, and the Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione "A. Faedo" of the National Research Council (ISTI-CNR), Pisa. 

The main goal of PapyrLab is to support the experts in recomposing papyri fragments. The tool provides suggestion to the experts during the reconstruction process and exploit both the front and back 
visual information of the fragments to achieve robust results. The tool can be used also to document the papyri reconstruction work.

PapyrLab is currently under development.
